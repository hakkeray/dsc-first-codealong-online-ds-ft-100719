By the end of the section, you should have a much stronger understanding of this process - even if you have no previous programming experience.\n",

This can alternatively be replaced with double quotes `df[\"col_name\"]`. In general, anything in quotations is a string in Python code. Occasionally, with very ill formatted column names with quotations in the names themselves, you may even need to wrap a name in triple quotes `df[\"\"\"col_name\"\"\"]` . This will rarely happen in this particular context, but it's the general pattern for dealing with messy strings.   \n",

Similar to tab completion with the command line, this is a primary reason why programmers use dashes (-) and underscores (_) in lieu of whitespace in their variable and file names. Also note that no quotations are used when using this format. (The column names have been stored as attributes of the DataFrame object!)"

    "The syntax for a slice is `[start:end]`.   \n",

    "You can also pass an additional third parameter `[start:end:count_by]` which will allow you to:  \n",

    "While we could have also used `df.State.head()`, slicing works for many more datatypes. This includes the previously mentioned *strings* as well as **lists** and other iterable objects. **Series**, the columns of the pandas DataFrame, are similar to Python's built in *lists*, but also have additional *methods* built in to them that we will continue to investigate."

Rather then import the entire package however, we import only the piece we intend to use (hence the dot notation) and again alias this under the shorthand *plt*.
